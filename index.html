  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">
  This project is built upon the research paper and repository SinGAN, developed by Tamar Rott Shaham, Tali Dekel, and Tomer Michaeli, available at <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf">paper</a> , <a href="https://github.com/tamarott/SinGAN">repo</a>.<br>
This project is the result of Harel Mendelman's personal endeavor, undertaken exclusively for the purpose of study.<br>
In this project, my primary aim was to enhance the original SinGAN architecture, with a particular focus on elevating the super-resolution aspect of SinGAN.<br>
  This website was created to ensure a comprehensive and organized presentation of my research results.<br>
